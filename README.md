# Project Title: 
Applied Statistical Modeling in R

# Description:

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Applied Statistical Modeling project conducted in R. The project focuses on analyzing and modeling various aspects of a dataset from Ajio, an online fashion retailer. Key areas explored in this project include pricing, discounts, brand impact, color impact, and gender-based analysis.

# Project Highlights:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An in-depth exploration of the Ajio dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

Hypothesis Testing: Rigorous statistical hypothesis tests to investigate the impact of brands, colors, and gender on pricing and discounts.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values, data transformation, and encoding categorical variables.

Visualizations: Utilization of data visualization techniques, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms, to present key findings.

Statistical Models: Building and assessing regression models to predict pricing based on various factors.

# Project Structure:

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the code and detailed analysis for each stage of the project.

Data: Raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.

Visualizations: Visualizations generated during the EDA and modeling process.
